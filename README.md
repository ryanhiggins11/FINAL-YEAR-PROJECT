# FINAL YEAR PROJECT
This is the repository for our final year project called "Biztech". This application is developed by Daniel Gallagher, Ryan Higgins, Shane McCormack, and Jack McNamee. The project is an application developed in Kotlin to allowed employees of companies to clock into their workplace. We decided to design this to help stop the spread of covid-19 in the workplace.
# PROJECT OVERVIEW
The app we developed was a clock-in application to use for employees to clock in using their own device rather than a clock-in station. As we are all aware Covid-19 is a huge problem in not only in the workplace but in everyday life. The application was coded in android studio using Koitlin. The app uses MongoDB to store the details used for our application. The managers of the business have exclusive access to the manager functions both inside the application and are the only people who have access to the website to view people's information or look at clock-in and out times.
The manager website was created using react, mern, node, and mongoDB express.  We created this site as a handy way for managers to be able to see what staff have clocked in and out of the workplace and at what time they did. This feature is extremely useful and secure as we have used WWwhisper to ensure that employees and people who are not authorized cannot use the site. Wwwhisper is built into Heroku where our website is hosted and only allowed authenticated emails to access the site.
